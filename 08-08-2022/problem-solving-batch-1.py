##Write a  Python Program using Multithreading ,
##Consider a couple who is having a Joint account and both are having their ATM cards.
##They come to different ATMs and try to withdraw some amount at the same time.
##Letâ€™s say the total balance in the account is 500 and Wife tries to withdraw 450
##and the husband tries to withdraw 100. When they swipe the card for withdrawing money,
##the balance shown will be 500. Two threads will be created for the transaction,
##out of which only one thread should be successful and the other should fail.
##If both the threads get successful then its a loss to the bank.
##So, the threads should be in synchronization so that one fails and the other wins.

    def __init__(self,a):
        self.a=a

    def wife(self,w):
        if w<=self.a:
            self.l.acquire(blocking=True)
            self.a-=w
            print(f"{w} amount withdraw success")
            print("current balance in joint ac: ",self.a)
        else:
            print("sorry insuffient balance: ",self.a)
